# Requirements
# Introduction
To build a basic c program that uses the hardware components and heats a car seat to a temperature as required by the driver.
It is done by monitoring the seating of the person and his requirement of heating temperature.
# SWOT Analysis- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities Threats
# Strengths
* Modular Based Programs.
* Easy to modify the temperature value.
# Weakness
* This application used in only very cold countries.
* And the files contain delay header file.
# Oppertunities
* Heaters can be replaced by wind blowers and air conditioners.
* Can be improvised with any harwares that read user input correctlly.
# Threats
* It would not work if harware connections go wrong. 

# 4W's and 1'H
* WHAT : Passanger Seat and Heat Monitoring System.
* WHERE : Used in automotive industry.
* WHEN : At low temperature.
* WHY : To withstand with sever low temperatures.
* HOW : By varinging the heater knob.
